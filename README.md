## Challenges and Learning Curves
This was quite a steep learning curve, to be honest and I did need a bit of help from my tutor. In particular, 'envisioning' the thing was tricky, as it was first time developing something that wasn't going to be deployed as a website. It was also difficult to 'hold' in my head all the moving parts, none of which are *that* comolicated in themselves, but all of which have to come together - licenses, badges, template literals, markdown, even using Zoom to record the thing in action! So there was a fari bit of head scratching going on at first. And at second and third, to be honest... 
## Future Development
I suppose it could grow along the lines of more questions or adding more complext text answers to some of the answers. Not particularly keen to go there for a while...
